    "## Analysis for the Urban and Rural areas\n",
    "\n",
    "As one of our research questions was to see the differences between what was considered urban vs rural areas, one of the objectives for this question was to find a way to define for each entry how to consider it a developed urban area or a low population density rural area. According to the case study performed by Cybera (Towards a clear understanding or rural internet) For comparing rural and municipal internet speeds, we could check if the entry or tile in that entry was assigned to a PCCLASS (Population Centry Type).\n",
    "\n",
    "Considering the previous statement, we could guess that any entry/tile with a \"Null\" value in the PCCLASS column could refer to a rural area. The other values for the Population Centre Type are:\n",
    "- 2 = Small Population Centre (population between 1,000 and 29,999)\n",
    "- 3 = Medium Population Centre (population between 30,000 and 99,999)\n",
    "- 4 = Large urban Population Centre (population of 100,000 or more)\n",
    "\n",
    "Before trying to analyze those tiles/entries without a PCCLASS, we could see how the Population Centres are performing in regards to the goal desired of 50 Mbps of download internet speed."
